New Year, New ABJAD!

<!--truncate-->

After two years from when **ABJAD** was born, I'm delighted to announce that our beloved language has taken a new path with the beginning of 2023!

## Changes {#changes}
- Moving to a fully web-based solution. **ABJAD** interpreting solution is now hosted over a microservices 
architecture that communicate over the internet.
- Initiated the move towards a typed-language. When **ABJAD** was born, it was a fully dynamically typed language. Now, a reference's type is required at declaration.
- Some syntax enhancements, such as the conditional statements, constructors, declaring variables, etc.
- Providing the user with more hands-on experience to the lexical analysis and parsed results.
