# Basics

**ABJAD** is similar in syntax to TypeScript. It resembles the C-family languages by using the curly braces {} to
enclose blocks, and a semicolon ؛ at the end of each statement.

Names and literals shall not contain dashes, white spaces, or any non-alphanumeric character. Perhaps, an underscore `_` is recommended for names that
consist of more than one word. e.g. `مقطع_كتابي` 

Names shall start only with a character from the alphabet. They can then have digits and underscores in the middle or the end.
