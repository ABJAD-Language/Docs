## What Is **ABJAD**? {#what-is-abjad}

### **ABJAD** is an Arabic Programming Language {#abjad-arabic-programming-language}

All of the main programming languages around the world are English-based languages, and using them requires prior
knowledge of English. For non-English speakers, this can be a major barrier that stops them from pursuing a path in
programming. That's why having an Arabic programming language can help accomplish the baby steps for newbies from the
Arab region to learn how to code.

The idea of having a local programming language when it comes to the Arab region isn't new, hence there are few Arabic
programming languages out there. However, what makes **ABJAD** different, is that it is very similar, in syntax, to
TypeScript, which makes it efficient for programmers who want to switch from Arabic programming language to an
English-based language.

### **ABJAD** is a Scripting Language {#abjad-scripting-language}

Similar to other main languages, such as Python and JavaScript, **ABJAD** is a scripting language, which means that it
requires minimal amount of code to start a program.

The shortest **ABJAD** code, that prints "Hello World! (In Arabic)" is:

```abjad
أكتب("مرحبا بالعالم!")؛
```

### **ABJAD** is an Interpreted Language {#abjad-interpreted-language}

Opposite to compiled languages, such as C and C++, **ABJAD** is an interpreted language, which puts it in the same class as
Python and JavaScript.

The main difference between interpreted and compiled languages is that interpreted languages require an interpreter that
takes a code as a text and runs it immediately, without any further steps.
On the other hand, compiled languages, require a compiler, that takes a code, analyzes it, and constructs a machine code
that resembles its functionality. This machine code is what the computer needs to execute.
