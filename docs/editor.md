Learn how to write and run **ABJAD** code online.

To try out the language by yourself you can head to the [interpreter](https://mohammed.ezzedine.me/abjad/interpreter) page and write some code.
You will notice that in addition to the final output, the interpreter helps you understand how a programming language functions by giving you a look on the:
1. mapping of words to tokens (Lexical Analysis).
2. tree of parsed declarations and statements.


You will also come across several examples of **ABJAD** code in the following documentation, so feel free to try it out!
